A very simple win32 utility that allows the user to resize a window
proportionally by hovering the mouse over the titlebar and scrolling up and/or
down with the mousewheel.

Run ScrollResize.exe with ScrollResizeDll.dll in the same directory to enable
the functionality, close the program to disable it.
